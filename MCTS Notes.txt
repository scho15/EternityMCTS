May need to implement UCB method and propogation for better selection
UCB taken ia normally average value plus 2 x square root of log visits at parent node/visits at child node
normally would expand node, calculate value for one of the nodes (UCB is infinite if no visits made) so select at random, perform simulations
to calculate average value, backpropogate to all nodes including parent, then start at top of tree again and re-determine state to visit
based on UCB of child nodes to see if same action would be taken. The issue may be that lots of early states are explored 
but at least exploration is being encouraged

Tried average and maximum values as alternatives for "value" and need to implement Q table to record values and number of visits
